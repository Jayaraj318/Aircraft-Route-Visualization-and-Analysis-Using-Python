# Aircraft-Route-Visualization-and-Analysis-Using-Python
This project visualizes aircraft travel routes using flight data, including attributes like icao24, callsign, geographic coordinates, and timestamps. The goal is to create an interactive map that displays the paths of aircraft, allowing users to explore flight patterns and distances.
